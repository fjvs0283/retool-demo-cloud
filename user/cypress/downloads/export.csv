12,HT-9512,Mechanical,Heat Exchanger,23.9,0.04,Cooling System,3,40000,1000 flight hours,"The heat exchanger is part of the cooling system that helps regulate the temperature of various systems within the airplane, particularly avionics and engines. Regular maintenance every 1,000 flight hours ensures the exchanger operates efficiently. Its placement in the cooling system is essential for maintaining operational temperatures, and during load planning, the volume and location of the heat exchanger are factored into thermal management considerations.",Notes
